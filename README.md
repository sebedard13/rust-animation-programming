# Rust Animation programming

This is a small project to gpu rendering and animation programming in Rust. This project follows the book C++ Game
Animation
Programming by Michael Dunsky and Gabor Szauer from 2023. While the book is in C++, I will try to implement the examples
in Rust, but the main goal is to learn about animation programming and not to make a direct translation from C++ to
Rust. In the book, the authors use the OpenGL or Vulkan API to render the animations, but I will use the wgpu-rs crate.
