# Rust Animation programming

This is a small project to gpu rendering and animation programming in Rust. This project follows a little bit the book
C++ Game Animation Programming by Michael Dunsky and Gabor Szauer from 2023 and
this [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) guide. While the book is in C++, I will try to implement the
examples in Rust, but the main goal is to learn about animation programming and not to make a direct translation from
C++ to Rust. In the book, the authors use the OpenGL or Vulkan API to render the animations, but I will use the wgpu-rs
crate.
