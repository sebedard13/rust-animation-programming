# Rust Animation Programming

This is a small project to learn GPU rendering and animation programming in Rust. This project follows the book C++ Game Animation Programming by Michael Dunsky and Gabor Szauer (2023) for the content of the software. While the book is in C++, I will try to implement the examples in Rust, but the main goal is to learn about animation programming and not to make a direct translation from C++ to Rust. In the book, the authors use the OpenGL or Vulkan API to render the animations, but I will use the wgpu-rs crate. [Learn Wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) is a great resource to learn about wgpu-rs.

## Status

The project is on pause, without finishing the book. I got to the chapter 10, but did not continue with chapter 11 for animation blending and Part 4 "Advancing Your Code to the Next Level". I will maybe continue the project in the future.
